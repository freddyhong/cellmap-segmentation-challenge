## Submission requirements:
1. The submission should be a single zip file containing a single Zarr-2 file with the following structure:
   - submission.zarr
     - /<test_volume_name>
        - /<label_name>
2. The names of the test volumes and labels should match the names of the test volumes and labels in the test data.
3. The scale for all volumes is 8x8x8 nm/voxel, except as otherwise specified.

Assuming your data is already 8x8x8nm/voxel,and each label volume is either A) a 3D binary volume with the same shape and scale as the corresponding test volume, 
or B) instance IDs per object, you can convert the submission to the required format using the following convenience functions:

- For converting a single 3D numpy array of class labels to a Zarr-2 file, use the following function:
  `cellmap_segmentation_challenge.utils.evaluate.save_numpy_labels_to_zarr`
Note: The class labels should start from 1, with 0 as background.

- For converting a list of 3D numpy arrays of binary or instance labels to a Zarr-2 file, use the following function:
  `cellmap_segmentation_challenge.utils.evaluate.save_numpy_binary_to_zarr`
Note: The instance labels, if used, should be unique IDs per object, with 0 as background.

The arguments for both functions are the same:
- `submission_path`: The path to save the Zarr-2 file (ending with <filename>.zarr).
- `test_volume_name`: The name of the test volume.
- `label_names`: A list of label names corresponding to the list of 3D numpy arrays or the number of the class labels (0 is always assumed to be background).
- `labels`: A list of 3D numpy arrays of binary labels or a single 3D numpy array of class labels.
- `overwrite`: A boolean flag to overwrite the Zarr-2 file if it already exists.

To zip the Zarr-2 file, you can use the following command:
`zip -r submission.zip submission.zarr`

To submit the zip file, upload it to the challenge platform.
